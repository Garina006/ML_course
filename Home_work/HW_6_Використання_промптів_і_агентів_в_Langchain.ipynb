It aims to bridge the gap between the \"black box\" nature of traditional AI systems and the need for human understanding and trust in the decision-making process.\n",

            "One of the key advantages of XAI is its potential to increase transparency and accountability in AI systems. By providing explanations for their decisions, XAI can help users understand and trust the results, leading to increased adoption and acceptance of AI technologies. This is particularly important in high-stakes applications such as healthcare, finance, and autonomous vehicles.\n",

            "Current areas of research in XAI include developing techniques for generating human-interpretable explanations, evaluating the quality and effectiveness of these explanations, and integrating XAI into existing AI systems. Other areas of focus include addressing the trade-off between explainability and performance, as well as developing methods for explaining complex deep learning models.\n",
